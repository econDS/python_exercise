The Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections.
A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey.
Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber.
Republicans currently control both legislative chambers.
President Trump is not up for re-election in the next two years, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office.
